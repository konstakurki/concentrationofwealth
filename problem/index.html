<h1>The problem</h1>

<p>In a stable yet advancing society wages rise at the same rate as fortunes of the richest. This is not true in our world—for example in the US the ratio of richest fortunes to a typical wage has doubled twice during the past 25 years. Largest fortunes are now worth more than million years of typical US work.</p>

<h2 id='wealth-concentration-in-a-nutshell'>1. Wealth concentration in a nutshell</h2>

<p>Business is not only powered by labor but also by technology. As technology advances, businesses become less and less dependent on human workers. This creates unemployment and encourages workers to compete instead of co-operate. Union power suffers and wages fail to keep up with large fortunes.</p>

<p>Technology advances fast and robots are taking over boring—which means almost all—jobs. In the near future unemployment will pass 50% and wages will dive. There won’t enough money to pay unemployment compensation, so most people have to first sell everything they have and then successfully beg or steal, or die.</p>

<p>A trader may loose a fortune. When this happens, they fall into poverty. On the other hand, it is not possible to climb up, since business always requires some capital. Furthermore, in a situation of extreme inequality monopoly power rules, and it’s virtually certain that an attempt to compete will be crushed.

<p>Due to Internet and free trade this all happens globally. Free trade also forces countries to compete by lowering taxes. This allows the wealthy to arrange things so that the taxes they pay approach 0%. Because rising unemployment and diving wages, also taxes paid by the working class are going down. Therefore, tax revenues of countries all over the world are going down, which means deteriorating social security, justice department and police.

<p>So unemployment rises, wages dive, traders drop one by one into poverty, and governments decay. We’re approaching a situation in which one person owns everything, and the rest will live in misery—or die. Obviously, something will happen before such a theoretical singularity is reached. Either we fix the problem, or our society collapses.</p>
