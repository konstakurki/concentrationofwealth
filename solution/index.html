<h1>A solution</h1>

<p>Concentration of wealth, a phenomenon that pushes a society towards oligarchy, is not a fault but a natural tendency of any evolving society. The most natural way to counter this force is to simply tax fortunes and share the revenue with everyone, that is, to use it to provide a universal basic income.

<h2>1. Basic income and wealth tax</h2>

<p>In the future unemployment cannot be treated as a special situation. Rather, it must be addressed as a normal situation, which has nothing to do with how decent citizen an unemployed person is.</p>

<p>The simplest and most respectful way to deal with mass unemployment is a gratuitous salary paid for every citizen for just being alive. Such a salary is called basic income. Every adult receives the same amount irrespective of their other income and net worth. Additionally a smaller basic income may be paid to underaged citizens, or to their parents.

<p>Basic income not only saves the lives of the unemployed, but also solves the problem of dying union power. When there’s basic income, a worker can say no to abusive job or too low wage. Wages automatically assume sizes of a couple of basic incomes. By adjusting the basic income, the ratio of wages to the largest fortunes can be made constant or decreasing.</p>

<p>Basic income costs a lot of money. Taking account the diminishing number of jobs, it will not be feasible—nor would it be fair—to finance it by taxing wages. It could be financed by taxing all income, yet total income, which is how much the net worth changes, is difficult to measure. Furthermore, income inequality is not ass serious problem as wealth inequality is.

<p>Measuring wealth is easier than measuring income, and the best way to finance the basic income is to tax wealth, not income. For example in the US a 3% annual wealth tax would bring about $600 of monthly basic income for each US citizen or about $800 for each adult US citizen.</p>

<p>Basic income financed by a wealth tax is a ridiculously simple, razor-sharp solution to the problem of wealth concentration, that lets us control economic inequality without explicitly intervening the markets. It should have existed since capitalism was born. We mus now hurry to build it into our system.</p>
